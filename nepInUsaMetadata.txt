Applying to colleges in the U.S. from Nepal involves a mix of simplicity and complexity. Although there are many consultancies in Putalisadak that can help expedite the process, they often charge a substantial fee for services that can be done on your own.

As a high-school graduate of 2016, I started my application process in May of 2016. I took SAT classes at a consultancy, only to later realize that I could have studied more effectively at home.

In this blog, I will outline the general steps for applying to most average U.S. universities. Applying to top-tier universities is more complex and will be covered in a separate series.

**Background:**

U.S. universities typically have two main intakes: Fall and Spring.

- The deadline for Spring intake (January) falls between October 15 and November 15. Consult the college's official website for exact dates.
- The deadline for Fall intake (August) falls between March 15 and June 15.

For highly-ranked universities, it's crucial to start the application process as early as November of the previous year, as there are various aspects to consider.

**Timeline:**

Planning is essential to avoid missing important deadlines. It's best to start early, allowing ample time to research universities based on your scores. Below is a recommended timeline for students applying for Spring intake. Those applying for Fall intake can plan accordingly.

1. Begin TOEFL and SAT classes by June (assuming high school completion in May).
2. Familiarize yourself with Collegeboard.org, ETS.org, and Khanacademy.org.
3. Take the TOEFL test around mid-August. Aim for a score of 100-110/120, which is considered decent for good colleges. However, many colleges accept scores as low as 61 for the Internet-Based TOEFL (IBT).
4. Excel in the SAT. Aim for a score of 1400/1600, which can open doors to elite schools.
5. Considering other responsibilities, take the SAT on October 1.
6. Use the extra month until November to search for colleges and write your essay (if not already decided).

Based on your SAT and TOEFL/IELTS scores, determine whether to apply for Fall or Spring intake. Generally, scores above 90 in TOEFL or 7 in IELTS, and above 1300 in SAT or 28 in ACT warrant aiming for Fall intake, as universities typically offer better scholarships during this admission period. If your scores are lower, consider applying for Spring intake instead.

**How to Apply:**

Before applying to any college, visit its official website to check English proficiency requirements.

1. Complete the online application form, usually found on the college's official website under the International Students tab.
2. Pay the application fee ($50-$100) at the bank. Some colleges offer free applications.
3. Locate the college's Center for International Students and obtain their email address.
4. Communicate with the Center for any questions regarding the application process, including whether hard copies or scanned copies of documents are acceptable.
5. If hard copies are mandatory, have them attested.
6. Send the documents via courier or email the scanned copies, depending on the college's requirements.
7. Provide a balance certificate indicating sufficient funds to cover the first year of college. Obtain this from your bank.
8. Send your English Proficiency Test scores and SAT scores (if required). Some colleges don't require SAT scores for admission. Verify via email or check the college's website.
9. Await an email regarding the admission decision and any scholarships awarded.
10. If accepted, import your I-20 (an acceptance letter with personal information and cost of attendance). This may cost around NPR
